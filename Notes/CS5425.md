# lecture 1: Big data introduction

## 1. 4V's 
* Volume   : Scale of data 
* Variety  : Different forms of data
* Velocity : Analysis of streaming data
* Veracity : Uncertainty of data (e.g. mislabelled data, cleaning data)

## Data Lake: place to store massive data (Structured & Unstructured)
* Challenges:
  * **Data Discovery** : Finding datasets for analysis 
    * => Large Scale
  * **Dataset Versioning** : maintain all versions of datasets for storage cost-saving, collaboration, auditing, and experimental reproducibility. 
    * => Duplicates from different projects & update & altering the schema &  disappearing/reappearing 
  * **Data diversity** : different forms & source
* Tasks (life cycle): Metadata Management, Ingestion, Extraction, Cleaning, Integration, Discovery, Versioning

## Cloud Computing 
* Utility Computing : Pay the Computing resources according how much you need 
* Everything as a service
  * Utility computing = Infrastructure as a Service (**IaaS**)
    * Rent the machine (e.g. Amazonâ€™s EC2, Rackspace)
  * Platform as a Service (**PaaS**)
    * Provide API & maintenance, upgrades (e.g. Google App Engine)
  * Software as a Service (**SaaS**)
    * e.g. Gmail, Salesforce

## Datacenter
### Building blocks
  * Datacenter => server racks => cluster switchs (=> servers (computers))
  * ~~~
     1 rack = 
     [   cluster switch  ]  <===========>  [   cluster switch  ]
     [ server (computer) ]                 [ server (computer) ] <=======||
     [ server (computer) ]                 [ server (computer) ] <=======||
     [ server (computer) ]                 [ server (computer) ] <==>[   rack switch  ]
     [ server (computer) ]                 [ server (computer) ] <=======||
     [        ...        ]                 [        ...        ] <=======||
  * **Switches** are used to connect multiple devices on the **same network** within the data center.
  * **Routers**, on the other hand, are used to tie **multiple networks** together.
  * **Server => Switch => Router => Internet <= Router <= Switch <= Server**
### Properties / Performance
* Bandwidth: Maximum Data / unit time (e.g. GB/s) , how fast?
* Latency: **time** taken for 1 packet to go from source to destination (one-way)  or from source to destination back to source (round trip) (e.g. ms) , how far?
* **Bandwidth vs Latency**
  * transmit **large** amount of data: bandwidth! (tells how long the transmission will take)
  * transmit **small** amount of data: latency! (tells how much delay will get the data)
### Memory / Data Access
![Storage Hierarchy](/pics/StorageHierarchy.png "Storage Hierarchy")

#### Local Server (Data transmited within computer) Compares
* Hardware absolute comparision
    * Mem size : DRAM < Flash << Disk
    * Latency : Disk >> Flash > Disk
    * Bandwidth : DRAM >> Flash > Disk

### Local Rack (Data transmitted from server to server) Compare
